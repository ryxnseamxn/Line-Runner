My girlfriend is a BFA Acting major, and I quite often am asked to run lines with them as a means to help them memorize their script. 

I love being able to help my girlfriend, but sometimes I'd rather not be doing something so tedious. This is why I am making this project.

Basically, I'm going to use python to take in a string using speech recognition, compare that to the lines that are written in the script, and use text to speech for the other parts in the script so that it can be more similar to the call and response experience than just reading the script as is. 

Honestly, I'm not sure how useful this will end up being, but I know that with some time it's something that I can accomplish.
